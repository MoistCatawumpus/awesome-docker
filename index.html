The file that contains all the docker services is begining to become too big to handle at the current state. I do not want it to come to this but I may have to remove the docker run commands & compose files.
An alternative to this would be some services being removed after a while to free up space for new ones.

Please add me on Discord if you have suggestions!

Stay tuned for more details!
